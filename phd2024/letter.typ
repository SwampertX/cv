Dear Professor Nicolai Kraus,

I am Yee-Jian Tan, an second-year Master's student at the
#link("https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php")[MPRI] (Parisian Masters of Research in Computer Science), in France.
I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position that you offered.
I am passionate about Type Theory for its ability to formalise mathematical proofs,
as well as topics around it such as mathematical logic and constructive mathematics.
In the rest of this letter, I would like to demonstrate some of my previous experience
in Type Theory and the metatheory of proof assistants, which are potentially relevant to the PhD offered.

Between May and August 2024, I completed my Master's Year 1 (M1) #link("https://www.yeejian.dev/")[internship] with
Yannick Forster at the Cambium team in INRIA Paris, working on the project
#link("https://www.yeejian.dev/files/240827-report.pdf")["Towards Formalizing the Guard Checker of Coq"],
which was awarded an Honourable Mention (Mention de Félicitations)
from École Polytechnique for L3/M1 internships.
The guard checker of Coq is the part of Coq's kernel that checks for the termination
of recursive functions in Coq, which is crucial for Coq's soundness as a proof assistant.
In this project, I implemented the guard checker of Coq in the Coq proof assistant
and documented its features and behaviours in my report.
I presented the project publicly twice, once as an invited speaker at the 
#link("https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/workshop-guarded-june24")[Workshop on the
Guard Condition of Coq], held on 3 June by the
#link("https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/index")[RECIPROG project] in Nantes, France;
as well as during the #link("https://coq-workshop.gitlab.io/2024/")[Coq Workshop 2024],
affiliated with #link("https://www.viam.science.tsu.ge/itp2024/")[ITP 2024] in Tbilisi, Georgia.


In 2022, I worked on formalizing the Modules system of Coq in MetaCoq during my
undergraduate internship with Nicolas Tabareau. Together with co-supervisors
Martin Henz and Yue Yang, I wrote my
#link("https://github.com/SwampertX/undergraduate-thesis")[bachelor's thesis] on
the same topic, which received an A grade from the National University of
Singapore, thus completing a dual bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
Mathematics with Highest Distinction.

During the first two semesters of my Master's Year 1 in 2023-24, I studied
the categorical formalization of type theory via Category with Families under
the supervision of Ambrus Kaposi. This
#link("https://www.yeejian.dev/files/m1-project-report.pdf")[project]
culminated in a small
formalization of a less-dependent version of Category with Families in Agda,
akin to Steve Awodey's Natural Models.


Besides, among the courses I studied in M1,
#link("http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/")[INF551
Computational Logic], taught by Samuel Mimram, was the most relevant to my
research interests. I was awarded full marks (20/20) in this course, where I
implemented, for the final project, a dependent type-checker / proof-assistant
supporting Dependent Function types, Equality types, and Natural Number types.
I am currently taking courses on
Proof Assistants (#link("https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=cours:c-2-7-2")[2.7.2]),
Foundations of Proof Systems
(#link("https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=cours:c-2-7-1")[2.7.1]),
Models of Programming Languages
(#link("https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=cours:c-2-2")[2.2]),
and Functional Programming
(#link("https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=cours:c-2-4-2")[2.4])
in the MPRI M2 programme.
In addition, I am also taking the Category Theory and Proof Theory courses in the
Master's in Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Computer Science
(#link("https://master.math.u-paris.fr/en/annee/m2-lmfi/")[LMFI]).

I personally have little experience in HoTT;
the only experience was with the #link("https://thehottgameguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/0-trinitarianism/index.html")[HoTT Game],
in particular the section on "Trinitarianism".
Regarding constructive mathematics,
I attended the Proof and Computation 2024 Autumn School in Fischbachau, Germany,
where I attended lectures and workshops by lecturers such as Theirry Coquand and Ingo Blechschmidt,
who talked about "Topos Theory and Constructive Mathematics" and
"An Invitation to Constructive Forcing" respectively.

If you are interested,
Yannick Forster (`yannick.forster@inria.fr`)
and Samuel Mimram (`samuel.mimram@polytechnique.edu`)
could be my academic references,
whom I did an internship with and studied the Computational Logic course with, respectively.

Thank you very much for considering my application, and I look forward to your
favorable response.
